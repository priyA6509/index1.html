        <dt>MORNING</dt>
        <dd>Morning food is called breakfast in English. It is the first meal of the day, eaten in the early morning to break the overnight fasting period. 
Key Details About Breakfast:
Purpose: It replenishes glucose levels to boost energy and alertness.
Timing: Usually consumed shortly after waking up.
Components: Commonly includes items like eggs, toast, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, coffee, or tea.
Variations: Sometimes called "brunch" if eaten later in the morning as a combination of breakfast and lunch.</dd>
        <dt>AFTERNOON</dt>
        <dd>Afternoon food in English can refer to lunch (midday meal, e.g., sandwiches, soup) or, more specifically in British English, Afternoon Tea, a light meal (3-5 PM) with tea, sandwiches, scones, and cakes, bridging the gap to dinner. A quick snack (biscuits, fruit, yogurt) is also common, sometimes called "elevenses" (around 11 AM) or just a "break". 
</dd>
       <dt>EVENING</dt>
        <dd>The most common English terms for the evening meal are dinner (the main meal, often formal) and supper (a lighter, more informal evening meal or a late snack), with regional variations like tea also used in the UK. While "dinner" usually means the large evening meal in modern usage, "supper" historically referred to a midday meal when "dinner" was later, but now often means a light, casual meal at home. </dd>
       <dt>NIGHT</dt>
       <dd>The main meal eaten at night is typically called dinner (often the largest meal) or supper (usually more informal or lighter). For food consumed very late, terms like "late-night snack" or "midnight snack" are used. Regional differences exist, with "supper" sometimes referring to a smaller meal after dinner. </dd>
